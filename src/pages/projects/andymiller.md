I was hired to design and develop a website for a client who needed a central place to display all his content. He has a podcast, several articles, and books and wanted a professional website that he could link to with all of his content on it.

I created the front end with Gatsby JS and used Sanity as the CMS, which allows the client to edit pages and add articles.
