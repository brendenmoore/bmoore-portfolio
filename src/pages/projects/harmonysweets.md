I desiged a simple business site for my wife who makes these amazing decorated sugar cookies. I had fun being able to work on a side project where I could explore some creative and fun design ideas to fit the brand.

One of my favorite features of the site is the [photos](https://harmonysweets.co/photos) page which is automatically updated based on a shared Google Photos album. All my wife has to do to update the photos on the site is add some photos to the shared album on her phone and the site will pick them up automatically and lay them out in a beutiful grid!

I'm also happy with how the "wavy sidebar" motif worked out and how the hamburger menu in mobile uses it as well.
